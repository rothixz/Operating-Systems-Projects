 *
 *  \brief Logging the internal state of the problem into a file.
 *
 *  Defined operations:
 *     \li file initialization
 *     \li writing the match header at the end of the file
 *     \li writing the game header at the end of the file
 *     \li writing the present state as a single line at the end of the file
 *     \li writing the game result at the end of the file
 *     \li writing the match result at the end of the file.
