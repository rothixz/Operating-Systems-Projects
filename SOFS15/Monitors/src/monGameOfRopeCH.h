 *  \brief Problem name: Game of the rope.
 *
 *  \brief Concept: Pedro Mariano
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Monitor internal data structure is made visible so that the students can develop and test separately the operations
 *  carried out by the referee, the coaches and the contestants.
 *
 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the coaches:
 *     \li reviewNotes
 *     \li callContestants
 *     \li informReferee
 *     \li endOperCoach.
