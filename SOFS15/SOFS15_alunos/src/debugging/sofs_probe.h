 *  \brief A monitoring toolkit.
 *
 *  This toolkit provides a simple monitoring system which allows the programmer to include messages into his/her code.
 *  The system may be turned on or off.
 *  The system uses a probing depth to determine which messages must be displayed. The depth is a positive value.
 *  Upon writing the code, one should assign a depth to every probing message.
 *  Upon activating the probing system, one sets the range of depths that must be logged or displayed.

 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           that better represents the error cause.
 *           (execute command <em>man errno</em> to get the list of system errors)
