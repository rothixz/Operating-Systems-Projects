 *
 *  \brief Access to buffered/unbuffered raw disk blocks and clusters.
 *
 *  The mean transfer time of a data block (cluster) between main memory and disk is typically at least tens of
 *  thousands of times longer than the transfer time of an equal data block (cluster) between two different locations
 *  in main memory.
 *  Thus, the operating system tries to keep in a private storage area copies of the data blocks (clusters) whose
 *  probability of access in the near future is higher.
 *
 *  The buffercache may be regarded as a storage area resident in main memory having the ability to store K data blocks
 *  of the device's storage space.
 *  Data transfer between the main memory and the device works according to the following rules:
 *    \li every time a data block (cluster) is required for reading, it is looked up in the storage area: if it is
 *        there, the contents is copied to the supplied buffer location; otherwise, it is first read from the device
 *        and stored in the buffercache (a new node in the storage area is initialized to it and its status is marked
 *        \e same), then its contents is copied to the supplied buffer location, as before
 *    \li every time a data block (cluster) is required for writing, it is looked up in the storage area: if it is
 *        there, the contents of the supplied buffer is copied into it and its status is marked \e changed; otherwise,
 *        a new node in the storage area is initialized to this data block (cluster), the contents of the supplied
 *        buffer is copied into it and its status is marked <em>changed</em>, as before
 *    \li because the number of nodes in the storage area is finite, whenever it happens that no more free nodes are
 *        available, the node that has not been accessed for the longest time is selected for replacement: its contents,
 *        if needed (the status is marked <em>changed</em>), is first transfered to the device, then it becomes
 *        available for a new assignment.
 *
 *  The following operations are defined:
 *    \li initialize the storage area and assign it to the storage device
 *    \li unassign the storage area from the storage device and perform the required housekeeping duties
 *    \li read a block of data from the buffercache
 *    \li write a block of data to the buffercache
 *    \li flush a block of data to the storage device
 *    \li synchronize a block of data with the same block in the storage device
 *    \li read a cluster of data from the buffercache
 *    \li write a cluster of data to the buffercache
 *    \li flush a cluster of data to the storage device
 *    \li synchronize a cluster of data with the same cluster in the storage device.

 *           that better represents the error cause.
