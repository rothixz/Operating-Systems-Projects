/**
 *  \file sofs_buffercacheinternals.h (interface file)
 *
 *  \brief Set of operations to internally manage the buffercache.
 *
 *  The buffercache is conceived as two double-linked lists: the first, based on the physical block number of the
 *  storage device it is referencing; the second, based on the order of last access to the block. Hence, one needs to
 *  define operations to insert, retrieve and access its nodes.
 *  One should notice that this module does not stand alone: it supposes a very tight coupling with the buffercache
 *  implementation, its only application.
 *
 *  The following operations are defined:
 *    \li access the first node of the double-linked list based on the physical block number of the storage device
 *    \li access the next node of the double-linked list based on the physical block number of the storage device
 *    \li check if a given block, whose physical number is given, has already been stored in the storage area
 *    \li insert a node in the two double-linked lists infrastructure
 *    \li retrieve a node from the two double-linked lists infrastructure
 *    \li move a node already present in the storage area to the head of the double-linked list based on the last access
 *        time.
