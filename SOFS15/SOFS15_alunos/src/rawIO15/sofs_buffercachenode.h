/**
 *  \brief Definition of the buffercache node data type.
 *
 *  The buffercache is conceived as two double-linked lists: the first, based on the block number of the storage device
 *  it is referencing; the second, based on the order of last access to the block.
 *  So, besides the pointers which are required to implement this dynamic structure, each node contains:
 *    \li a buffer area to store locally the contents of the referenced block
 *    \li the physical block number
 *    \li a status flag which signals whether the block contents is, or is not, synchronized with the contents of the
 *        corresponding block in the storage device.
