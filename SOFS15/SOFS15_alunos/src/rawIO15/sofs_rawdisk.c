 *  \brief Access to raw disk blocks and clusters.
 *
 *  The storage device is presently a Linux file which simulates a magnetic disk.
 *  The following operations are defined:
 *    \li open a communication channel with the storage device
 *    \li close the communication channel previously established
 *    \li read a block of data from the storage device
 *    \li write a block of data to the storage device
 *    \li read a cluster of data from the storage device
 *    \li write a cluster of data to the storage device.
