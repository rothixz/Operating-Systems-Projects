 *  \brief Access to raw disk blocks and clusters.
 *
 *  The storage device is presently a Linux file which simulates a magnetic disk.
 *  The following operations are defined:
 *    \li open a communication channel with the storage device
 *    \li close the communication channel previously established
 *    \li read a block of data from the storage device
 *    \li write a block of data to the storage device
 *    \li read a cluster of data from the storage device
 *    \li write a cluster of data to the storage device.

 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           that better represents the error cause.
 *           (execute command <em>man errno</em> to get the list of system errors)
