 *
 *  \brief Set of operations to manage the file system internal data structures.
 *
 *
 *  The aim is to provide an unique storage location when the file system is in operation.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li load the contents of the superblock into internal storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of the superblock
 *      \li store the contents of the superblock resident in internal storage to the storage device
 *      \li convert the inode number, which translates to an entry of the inode table, into the logical number (the
 *          ordinal, starting at zero, of the succession blocks that the table of inodes comprises) and the offset of
 *          the block where it is stored
 *      \li load the contents of a specific block of the table of inodes into internal storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific block of the table of inodes
 *      \li store the contents of the block of the table of inodes resident in internal storage to the storage device
 *      \li convert the index number, which translates to an entry of the references to free data clusters table, into
 *          the logical number (the ordinal, starting at zero, of the succession blocks that the table of references to
 *          free data clusters comprises) and the offset of the block where it is stored
 *      \li load the contents of a specific block of the table of references to free data clusters into internal storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific block of the table of references to free data clusters
 *      \li store the contents of the block of the table of references to free data clusters resident in internal storage
 *          to the storage device
 *      \li convert a byte position in the data continuum (information content) of a file, into the index of the element
 *          of the list of direct references and the offset within it where it is stored
 *      \li load the contents of a specific cluster of the table of single indirect references to data clusters into
 *          internal storage.
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific cluster of the table of single indirect references to data
 *          clusters
 *      \li store the contents of a specific cluster of the table of single indirect references to data clusters
 *          resident in internal storage to the storage device
 *      \li load the contents of a specific cluster of the table of direct references to data clusters into internal
 *          storage
 *      \li get a pointer to the contents of a specific cluster of the table of direct references to data clusters
 *      \li store the contents of a specific cluster of the table of direct references to data clusters resident in
 *          internal storage to the storage device.

 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           that better represents the error cause.
