 *  The formats are:
 *      \li block/cluster contents as hexadecimal data
 *      \li block/cluster contents as ascii/hexadecimal data
 *      \li block/cluster contents both as hexadecimal and ascii data
 *      \li block contents as superblock data
 *      \li block contents as inode data
 *      \li single inode data
 *      \li cluster contents as a byte stream
 *      \li block/cluster contents as a sub-array of data cluster references
 *      \li cluster contents as a sub-array of directory entry data.
