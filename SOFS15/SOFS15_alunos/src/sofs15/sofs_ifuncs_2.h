 *
 *  \brief Set of operations to manage inodes: level 2 of the internal file system organization.
 *
 *  The aim is to provide an unique description of the functions that operate at this level.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li read specific inode data from the table of inodes
 *      \li write specific inode data to the table of inodes
 *      \li check the inode access permissions against a given operation.
 *

 *  \author Ant√≥nio Rui Borges - September 2010 / September 2012
 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           or the local error that better represents the error cause. Local errors are out of the range of the
 *           system errors.
