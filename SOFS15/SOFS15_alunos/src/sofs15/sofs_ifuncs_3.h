 *  \brief Set of operations to manage data clusters: level 3 of the internal file system organization.
 *
 *  The aim is to provide an unique description of the functions that operate at this level.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li read a specific data cluster
 *      \li write to a specific data cluster
 *      \li handle a file data cluster
 *      \li free all data clusters from the list of references starting at a given point.

 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           or the local error that better represents the error cause. Local errors are out of the range of the
 *           system errors.

/**
 *  \brief Handle of a file data cluster.

 *  The list of valid operations is
 *

 *    \li ALLOC:      allocate a new data cluster and include it in list of references of the the inode which

 *    \li FREE:       free the referred data cluster and dissociate it from the list of references of the inode
 *                    which describes the file.
 *
 *  Depending on the operation, the field <em>clucount</em> and the lists of direct references, single indirect
 *  references and double indirect references to data clusters of the inode associated to the file are updated.
 *
 *  Thus, the inode must be in use and belong to one of the legal file types in all cases.
