 *  \brief Set of operations to manage directories and directory entries: level 4 of the internal file system
 *         organization.
 *
 *         The aim is to provide an unique description of the functions that operate at this level.
 *
 *  The operations are:
 *      \li get an entry by path
 *      \li get an entry by name
 *      \li add a generic entry / attach an entry to a directory to a directory
 *      \li remove / detach a generic entry from a directory
 *      \li rename an entry of a directory
 *      \li check a directory status of emptiness.

 *
 *  \remarks In case an error occurs, all functions return a negative value which is the symmetric of the system error
 *           or the local error that better represents the error cause. Local errors are out of the range of the
 *           system errors.
