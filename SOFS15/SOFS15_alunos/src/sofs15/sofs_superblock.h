 *  It contains global information about the file system layout, namely the size and the location of the remaining
 *  parts.
 *
 *  It is divided in:
 *     \li <em>header</em> - that contains data about the type, the version, the name, the size in number of physical
 *         blocks and the consistency status
 *     \li <em>inode table metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in number of blocks, total number of inodes and
 *         number of free inodes; the inode table is primarily conceived as an array of inodes, however, the free inodes
 *         form a double-linked circular list whose insertion / retrieval point is also provided (dynamic circular FIFO
 *         that links together, using the inodes themselves as nodes, all the free inodes)
 *     \li <em>data zone metadata</em> - concerning its location, size in total number of data clusters, number of free
 *         data clusters and its three main reference components: the insertion and retrieval caches for a fast temporary
 *         storage of references (static structures resident within the superblock itself) and the location and size in
 *         number of blocks of the table of references to free data clusters, organized as a static linear FIFO that
 *         links together all the free data clusters whose references are not in the caches - the insertion and retrieval
 *         points are also provided.
